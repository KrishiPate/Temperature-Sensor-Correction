# Temperature-Sensor-Correction

Dataset of readings of different temperature sensors (including the faulty) was provided.

A Model was prepared wiht Python to get the corrected temperature values by using Denoising (using a
kernel function) and Deblurring (using Fourier Transform without Library functions) techniques.

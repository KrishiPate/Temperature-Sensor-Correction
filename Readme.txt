### General Info
***
One of the numerous applications of Internet of Things (IoT)comprises nonstop checking of temperature in a zone.
To that conclusion, a few temperature sensors are introduced in diverse areas. These sensors measure and store the 
recorded esteem of temperature over time. In any case, due to restrictions of hardware, the sensor memory must be 
cleared occasionally, which can be done by transmitting the put-away values to a base unit.
Based upon the above process:
* x[n] denotes the samples of the true value of temperature recorded by a sensor and is in the form of a continuous signal.
* y[n] denotes the received signal at the base unit which suffers from blur distortions and noise(additive).
    [Continuous time signal get converted into Discrete-Time Signal]

```
### How to run Code
***
After customizing your IDE, to run the given code and you have to follow the below steps:
```
* Open Pycharm in your system
* Click file tab in top right corner and select open menu.
* Open codeFile.py by entering the location of file as per your system.
* Then run the programm and give the inputs of y and x when the program asks you by manually typing it. 
   (just copy paste the mentioned inputs from the data sheet)
```
